Background
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

Your first task is to visualize an earthquake dataset. Complete the following steps:

Get your dataset. To do so, follow these steps:

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the USGS GeoJSON FeedLinks to an external site. page and choose a dataset to visualize.

Then using D3.Json and Leaflet created via livestream a map with circles varying in size by the magnitude of the earthquake and a legend with the different depth of earthquake by color.

What was interesting was looking at Turket which recently has had deadly earthquakes but the depth was not as deep as earthquakes near the artic area.
By clicking on each circle the location and depth is also shown.

NOte I zoomed out to see the world and then could zoom in to varying countries.
